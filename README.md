# Hotel-Management-System
## Introduction
Hotel “Kabalana” is the only hotel in Sri Lanka which inspired by most creative cultures of an ancient palace in Alexandria, Egypt. “Kabalana” hotel provides a magnificent view of the Indian Ocean and stunning sunset. “Kabalana” hotel’s location is known to many as the best surfing destination in down south. This hotel has around 45 room capacity with many categories and for desirable price ranges. The hotel has all the bar facilities, restaurant facilities and other luxurious facilities like outdoor swimming pools, halls, etc.    Currently, the hotel has an existing hotel management system to perform its usual functions but they don’t use it much because of its complexity and sometimes it doesn’t produce the outputs as they expected. So, they were asked from us to produce a system to do their work more accurately according to their specific requirements. 

### Problems

Hotel staff need to manage a huge number of guests and the management board of the hotel doesn’t have an automated system that calculates the employee salaries of the hotel too. So, managing guest details, bills and their other details and managing employee salaries in an efficient manner are the main problems they faced right now. 


* [They must calculate employee salaries and store other details manually.]
* [They must store supplier details manually.]
* [In most cases the existing system is not user-friendly and not giving their expected output, because of that they need to insert details of the restaurant and other sections manually and calculate the outputs manually. ]
